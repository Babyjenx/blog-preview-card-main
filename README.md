Building out with basic html and css. This was my first introduction to flexbox.

### Built with

â€“ Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I was really happy to make improvements from my last coding project. Using the CSS Reset was super helpful at getting rid of tricky overlapping margin issues. I was also able to accurately and more responsively center the design.


### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning responsiveness particularly how to come up with rem measurements instead of pixel measurements in future projects.

I also can't figuere out why my cursor: pointer; is only visible sometimes. It seems like it's just not working but it's probably an issue with my code. Any pointers would be helpful!
